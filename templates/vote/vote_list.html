{% block summary %}
<h1>Voting Records</h1>

<p>Each year the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives take thousands of vote, some to pass bills, resolutions, nominations, and treaties, and others on procedural matters such as on cloture and other motions. Not all votes are recorded, such as when there is no one opposed. This page shows the outcome of all recorded votes on the Senate and House floor.</p>
