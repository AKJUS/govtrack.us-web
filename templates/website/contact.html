	<h1>Contact Us</h1>

  <p>Thank you for your interest in GovTrack.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>GovTrack is <b style="font-size: 200%">not a government website</b>, therefore:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We can&rsquo;t help you with a problem you are having with an agency or other legal matters.</li>
    <li>We can&rsquo;t forward messages to Members of Congress.</li>
    <li>We can&rsquo;t help you book a White House tour.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Before you email us your opinion about a bill in Congress, please keep in mind that we don&rsquo;t have a vote!</p>
  <p>To voice your opinion, contact your representative (not us!). You can use our site to <a href="/congress/members">find your representative</a>. Then go to his or her website and look for their contact information there.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Looking for more information?</h3>

  <p>We do not have any additional information on the status of a bill that isn&rsquo;t already posted on the page for the bill on this website.</p>

  <p>We can&rsquo;t explain bills &mdash; we don&rsquo;t have any special insight into what they mean.</p>

  <h3>Trying to unsubscribe?</h3>

  <p>Please <a href="/accounts/profile">edit your account settings</a>. It&rsquo;ll be faster than emailing us. If you have any trouble, please do email.</p>
