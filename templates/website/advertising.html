		<h2>About the Ads You See</h2>
		
		<p>GovTrack.us is a project of <a href="http://www.civicimpulse.com/">Civic Impulse, LLC</a>. We are a small for-profit company trying to make the world better. We sell ad space here to cover our operating costs and to pay our staff. Without advertising, GovTrack as you know it would not be possible. (<a href="/about">More about us...</a>)</p>
	
		<p>Ads on GovTrack work just like the ads you see on TV or in newspapers. We don&rsquo;t solicit ads from one side of the political spectrum or the other. Instead, we sell our ad space to anyone who will pay our ad rates.</p>
		
		<p>To maintain our independence from the advertisers, and to reduce the cost to us of managing our ad space, our ad space is currently managed by <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a> and <a href="http://www.care2.com/">Care2</a>. In most cases we do not know who is advertising on GovTrack. Occasionally we sell limited ad space directly to advertisers.</p>
