	<h2>How it works</h2>

	<p>GovTrack helps you find the status of U.S. federal legislation, voting records for the Senate and House of Representatives, information on Members of Congress, congressional district maps, and the status of state legislation.</p>

	<p>Much of the information shown on GovTrack is assembled in an automated way from official federal government websites. We use the website <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/">THOMAS</a>, for instance, which is the official website for the status of federal legislation and is run by the Library of Congress. The process of gathering the information is entirely automatic and Congress isn&rsquo;t always very happy to share, so you may find occasional errors here, but we take errors very seriously and work hard to correct them.</p>
	
	<p>State legislative information is available here through a partnership with <a href="http://www.BillTrack50.com">LegiNation, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.LegiScan.com">LegiScan, Inc.</a> Some data is additionally from <a href="http://openstates.org/">Open States</a>. (State legislative information is new to GovTrack as of June 2012.)</p>


	<h2>More about the site</h2>

	<p>Launched in 2004 as merely the hobby of a private citizen, GovTrack.us was the first website world-wide to provide free, comprehensive legislative tracking for citizens. Since then GovTrack has been reported on widely (see our <a href="/press">press clippings</a>) and has grown into a respected model for government transparency.</p>
	
	<p>The site was created and is run by <a href="http://razor.occams.info">Joshua Tauberer</a> and became a project of <a href="http://www.civicimpulse.com">Civic Impulse, LLC</a> when he formed the company in 2009. GovTrack isn&rsquo;t affiliated with the government, and our only ongoing funding comes from advertising. To send us a note, email <a href="mailto:operations@govtrack.us">operations@govtrack.us</a>.</p>

	<p>We pull in federal legislative data about as fast as Congress makes it available on their websites. The status and text of legislation is usually delayed by about 24 hours, and roll call votes usually appear here within an hour. Our database also extends into the past. You can search and browse bills going back to the 93rd Congress &mdash; that&rsquo;s 1973-74 &mdash; and the text of legislation goes back as far as the 106th Congress (1999-2000). Roll call votes are available back to the start of our nation!</p>

	<p>GovTrack openly shares the data it brings together so that other websites can build other tools to help citizens engage with government. Apps based on GovTrack&rsquo;s legislative database include <a href="http://www.opencongress.org">OpenCongress</a>, <a href="http://www.maplight.org">MAPLight</a>, <a href="http://manybills.researchlabs.ibm.com/">IBM ManyBills</a>, and many projects of the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a> including the <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/projects/android-congress/">Congress</a> Android app, <a href="http://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/">Scout</a>, and <a href="http://calloncongress.sunlightfoundation.com/">Call on Congress</a>.

	<h2>The Open Government / Open Government Data / Government Transparency Movements</h2>
	
	<p>The open government movement involves citizens, web developers, designers, researchers, writers, statisticians, government managers, and elected officials in a concerted effort to make data a national asset, to make government more transparent and effective, and to empower citizens to participate effectively in governance and in their communities.</p>
	
	<p>Since our launch in 2004, GovTrack has been a leader in the growing and changing open government movement. GovTrack&rsquo;s creator, Josh, also works on the policy angle of open government data. He wrote about it in the book <a href="http://opengovdata.io">Open Government Data: The Book</a> (2012).</p>
