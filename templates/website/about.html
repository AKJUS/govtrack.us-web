	<h2>How it works</h2>

	<p>GovTrack helps you find the status of U.S. federal legislation, voting records for the Senate and House of Representatives, information on Members of Congress, congressional district maps, and the status of state legislation.</p>

	<p>We assemble most of the information here in an automated way by scanning federal government websites, including <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/">THOMAS</a> for the status of legislation. State legislative information is available here through a partnership with <a href="http://www.BillTrack50.com">LegiNation, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.LegiScan.com">LegiScan, Inc</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Once we get the information, we make it easier to understand and we let you track bills for updates with <a href="/start">email updates and RSS feeds</a>. We also have unique statistical analyses to put the information in context. Read the <a class="imp" href="/about/analysis">&laquo;Analysis Methodology&raquo;</a>.</p>

	<p>GovTrack openly shares the data it brings together so that other websites can build other tools to help citizens engage with government. See the <a class="imp" href="/developers">&laquo;Developer Documentation&raquo;</a> for more.</p>
	
	<h2>Who we are</h2>

	<p>GovTrack was created in 2004 by <a href="http://razor.occams.info">Joshua Tauberer</a> originally as a hobby. Today it is a project of <a href="http://www.civicimpulse.com">Civic Impulse, LLC</a>, his company. See our <a class="imp" href="/press">&laquo;Press Clippings&raquo;</a> to read what people think of the site.</p>
	
	<p>GovTrack isn&rsquo;t affiliated with the government, and our only funding comes from advertising. You can read our <a  class="imp"href="/advertising">&laquo;Advertising Policy&raquo;</a>.</p>
	
	<p>To send us a note, email <a href="mailto:operations@govtrack.us">operations@govtrack.us</a>.</p>

	<p>Site design is by <a href="http://www.villagecreative.com">Village Creative</a>. Past designs were by Ben Rellick and Daniel Gabriele. Past staff members and contributors include <a href="http://lorien.name/">Grigoriy Petukhov</a> and Kevin Henry.</p>
	
	<h2>Information timeliness</h2>
	
	<p>We pull in federal legislative data about as fast as Congress makes it available on their websites. The status and text of legislation is usually delayed by about 24 hours, and roll call votes usually appear here within an hour.</p>
	
	<p>Our database also extends into the past. You can search and browse bills going back to the 93rd Congress &mdash; that&rsquo;s 1973-74 &mdash; and the text of legislation goes back as far as the 106th Congress (1999-2000). Roll call votes are available back to the start of our nation!</p>

	<h2>The Open Government / Open Government Data / Government Transparency Movements</h2>
	
	<p>The open government movement involves citizens, web developers, designers, researchers, writers, statisticians, government managers, and elected officials in a concerted effort to make data a national asset, to make government more transparent and effective, and to empower citizens to participate effectively in governance and in their communities.</p>
	
	<p>Since our launch in 2004, GovTrack has been a leader in the growing and changing open government movement. GovTrack&rsquo;s creator, Josh, also works on the policy angle of open government data. He wrote about it in the book <a href="http://opengovdata.io">Open Government Data: The Book</a> (2012).</p>
