	<p style="font-size: 110%; font-weight: bold; font-family: Roboto Slab;">GovTrack.us tracks the United States Congress and helps Americans understand what is going on in their national legislature.</p>

	<p>We publish the status of federal legislation, information about your representative and senators in Congress including voting records, and original research on <a href="https://govtrackinsider.com/">GovTrack Insider</a>.</p>

	<p>Use GovTrack to track bills for updates by <a href="/start">getting alerts</a> and understand the broader context of legislation through our <a href="/about/analysis">statistical analyses</a>.</p>

	<p>You can read more about <a href="/about-our-data">the data we have</a>. GovTrack was the first to create comprehensive open data about Congress (see the <a href="/developers">developer docs</a>), and we have successfully lobbied Congress to make more and better legislative information available to the public.</p>
