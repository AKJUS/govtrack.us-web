	<h1>Developer Documentation</h1>
	<p>Want to build an app? Part of GovTrack&rsquo;s core mission is to make legislative data freely available so that others can build new tools to promote civic education and engagement.</p>
	<p>GovTrack applies the principles of open data to legislative transparency. We screen scrape <a href="/about">a variety of official government websites</a> each day and make the resulting normalized database of legislative information available for free for reuse &mdash; in bulk (since 2005) and with an API (since 2012). Our database is the foundation for <a href="/developers/downstream">dozens of other open government websites</a>.</p>

	<h2>How do I get the data?</h2>
		
	<p><a href="/developers/data">Bulk Data</a>. Our bulk data contains the raw data behind most everything you see on GovTrack in XML or JSON format (and sometimes both). You can download the bulk data using <tt>rsync</tt>, a common Unix data transfer utility. We began making our bulk data available in 2005.</p>
	
	<p><a href="/developers/api">API</a>. The API is appropriate for use in applications that need only small slices of our data at a time. If you intend to query data in bulk, use our <a href="/developers/data">bulk data</a> instead. Our first API went online in May 2012. It is currently in version 2.</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://gis.govtrack.us/map/demo/cd-2012/">GIS API and Maps</a>. We host a map server and API for United States Congressional Districts, 113th Congress (i.e. 2012 elections and on), based on the geographic data made available by the U.S. Census.</p>

	<h2>What about source code?</h2>
		
	<p>Our github repository at <a href="https://github.com/govtrack/govtrack.us-web">github:govtrack/govtrack.us-web</a> contains the source code for the Django front-end that you see at govtrack.us. Pull requests are welcome! Our front-end source code is not openly licensed right now, but if you want to stand it up for a different government/jurisdiction drop us a a line.</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://github.com/govtrack/congress-legislators">github:unitedstates/congress-legislators</a>. This repository maintains a comprehensive database of all Members of Congress since 1789. The github account contains YAML files which you can load into your application. You can also find the files in our <a href="/developers/data">bulk data</a>, including in CSV format.</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">github:unitedstates/congress</a>. This is an open source community project to compile a comprehensive database of U.S. federal legislation. It is based in part on the source code we developed in the early 2000&rsquo;s to scrape THOMAS, and now we maintain the new code with others as part of a group effort. The project provides <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress/wiki">bulk data downloads</a>, or you can run the Python scripts yourself on your own schedule, and we make the data available through our <a href="/developers/data">bulk data</a>.</p>
