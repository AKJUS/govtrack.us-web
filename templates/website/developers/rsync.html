	<h1>Getting Bulk Raw Data with Rsync</h1>

	<p>To download GovTrack&rsquo;s raw data files in bulk, or if you plan to regularly update the files,
	you should use the rsync tool. Rsync is good for selecting which directory of data you want and
	keeping your files up to date by only downloading changes on each update.</p>
	
	<p>Using rsync is pretty easy on Linux and Mac if you are comfortable with the command line. It is harder on Windows. Windows users may prefer the <a href="/developers/api">GovTrack API</a>.</p>
	
	<h2><span>rsync on Linux and Mac</span></h2>
	
	<p>Once you install rsync, just type on a command-line:</p>
	
	<pre class="code">rsync -avz --delete --delete-excluded govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/112/bills .</pre>
	
	<p>That is all one line. Note the double colons and the period at the end.</p>
	
	<h2><span>rsync on Windows</span></h2>
	
	<p>On Windows, install <a href="http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp">DeltaCopy</a>,
	which contains rsync for Windows. Then on a command line type:</p>
	
	<pre class="code">mkdir C:\GovTrackData
cd "\Program Files\Synametrics Technologies\DeltaCopy"
rsync -avz --delete govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/112/bills /GovTrackData</pre>

	<p>Note that you have to give a relative path to your GovTrackData directory
	because rsync will interpret "C:" as something other than a drive letter,
	since there are no drive letters in the Unix world. Watch out for the double colons in the middle.</p>

	<p>This will put bill XML files in either C:\GovTrackData\bills or C:\cygwin\GovTrackData\bills.
	cygwin is the name of a common Windows wrapper around Unix tools. That's something to do with
	DeltaCopy, not GovTrack.</p>
