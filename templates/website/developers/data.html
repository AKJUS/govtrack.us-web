	<h1>Data Documentation</h1>
	
	<p>The underlying data about the U.S. Congress that powers this 
	site is the only such database made freely available for others 
	to reuse. The data covers the activity of bills, PDFs of bill 
	texts, roll call votes, and photos of members of Congress.  
	Almost all of the data files are in XML format.</p>
	
{% endblock %}
{% block body %}
	<p>You can browse 
	the underlying source data for this website <a 
	href="/data/">here</a>. These are the very same data files that 
	GovTrack uses to make itself go, so pretty much anything you see 
	on the site is in one of those files.</p>

	<p>The data files are released into the public domain but see the
	<a href="license">license terms</a> which covers your access.
	Please contact me if you would like to start using the
	data, just because I'm curious and like to know what it's being
	used for. Also, if you are an ongoing user of the data it is
	really important that you <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/govtrack/">join the GovTrack mail list</a>
	to stay updated with any data format changes which are occasionally
	not backwards compatible.</p>

	<h2><a name="data"></a>Data Directory</h2>
	
	<p>Here is an overview of much of the data provided by GovTrack.
	Read on below for how to access the data. Occasional downloads
	by HTTP are permitted, but in most cases the only supported method
	for you to get these files is to download them in bulk with Unix
	rsync (see below).</p>

	<ul>
	<li>The root of the data directory is <a href="/data">http://www.govtrack.us/data</a>. Feel free to explore. However, do not use HTTP to refresh a file more than once daily or to download data in bulk. See the section on rsync below for that.</li>
	
	<li><a href="/data/us/people.xml">data/us/people.xml</a>:
	This file contains everyone that has ever served in Congress, and U.S. presidents, with their party
	affiliation, terms in Congress, birthdays, etc.
	This file is quite large... best not to open it in your browser.
	This file has been put together from a variety of sources and is
	maintained by hand. See the schema documentation below.</li>

	<li>The <a href="/data/photos">data/photos</a> directory 
	contains jpeg images of Members of Congress, past and present. 
	Not all MoC's have photos. The name of the photo is the GovTrack 
	numeric identifier for the person followed by: nothing, for the 
	largest original image available; 200px, 100px, 50px, for three 
	sizes of the photo, by width; all followed by .jpeg. -credit.txt files
	give a tab-delimeted source URL and source description information
	for each photo.</li>
	
	<li>Most other files are organized by "Congress". A "Congress" 
	is a two-year session of activity, starting in the year after an 
	election year. Many things in Congress reset after each two year 
	term, such as bill numbers. In GovTrack, a "Congress" is called 
	a "session", which is actually a misnomer because each 
	"Congress" is made up of two "sessions" which follow the 
	calendar years. 2011 starts the 112<sup>th</sup> Congress.
	Each session is in its own directory: data/us/112, data/us/111,
	data/us/110, etc. We have roll call data going back to the first
	Congress, so we have that going back to data/us/1.</li>
	
	<li><a href="/data/us/sessions.tsv">data/us/sessions.tsv</a>
	gives the start and end date of each (one-year) session and 
	(two-year) Congress.</li>

	<li><a href="/data/us/111/people.xml">data/us/111/people.xml</a>
	mimics the layout of the full people.xml file but
	only contains those Members of Congress who have or had a role
	during this particular session of Congress. See the schema documentation below.</li>
	
	<li>Roll call votes in <a href="/data/us/111/rolls">data/us/111/rolls</a>
	represent all votes where individual votes have been recorded. Votes by unanimous consent, for instance,
	are not included here. The format of this file type is described in the schema documentation below.</li>

	<li>Bills are resolutions are encoded in <a href="/data/us/111/bills">data/us/111/bills</a>.
	The format of this file type is described in the schema documentation below.</li>

	<li><a href="/data/us/gis/zip4dist-prefix.txt.gz">data/us/gis/zip4dist-prefix.txt.gz</a>:
	A table (.gz-compressed) mapping ZIP+4 codes to congressional districts.
	If all zipcodes starting with a prefix map to the same district, only
	the prefix is included. An entry like "123 NY-01" means all zip and zip4
	codes starting with "123" are in New York's first congressional district.
	Current as of the summer of 2008; this comes from work by Carl Malamud
	and Aaron Swartz <a href="http://watchdog.net/about/api#zip2rep">here</a>.</li>
	
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="bulkaccess"></a>Bulk Access</h2>
	
	<p>To download files in bulk, or if you plan to regularly update files,
	you must use the rsync tool. I require rsync because it will only download
	updated files when you want to refresh your local files, and it supports
	compression.</p>
	
	<h3>Getting the Data On Linux/Mac OS X</h3>
	<p>rsync is available on Linux and you should be
	able to find it for Mac OS X as well; just type on a command-line e.g.:</p>
	
	<pre class="code">rsync -az --delete --delete-excluded govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/111/bills .</pre>
	
	<p>This will download the 111th Congress bill data into a directory
	called <tt>bills</tt> in the current directory.</p>

	<h3>Getting the Data on Windows</h3>
	
	<p>On Windows, install <a href="http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp">DeltaCopy</a>,
	which contains rsync for Windows. Then on a command line type:</p>
	
	<pre class="code">mkdir C:\GovTrackData
cd "\Program Files\Synametrics Technologies\DeltaCopy"
rsync -avz --delete govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/111/bills /GovTrackData</pre>

	<p>Note that you have to give a relative path to your GovTrackData directory
	because rsync will interpret "C:" as something other than a drive letter,
	since there are no drive letters in the Unix world.</p>

	<p>This will put bill XML files in either C:\GovTrackData\bills or C:\cygwin\GovTrackData\bills.
	cygwin is the name of a common Windows wrapper around Unix tools. That's something to do with
	DeltaCopy, not GovTrack.</p>

	<h3>What This Does</h3>
	
	<p>This will download the 111th Congress bill data. The first
	download should be roughly 75MB.  Subsequent updates will
	be much less.  The directory structure exposed by rsync mirrors
	the HTTP-browsable <a href="/data">data</a> directory (but, again,
	please don't do massive downloading by HTTP).</p>
	
	<p>The source data in all is 16 gigabytes, so <b>don't
	think about downloading the whole thing in one shot</b>.  And
	be nice on my bandwidth.</p>

	<p>The XML files are updated roughly daily (a good time for you
	to rsync them is 4PM Eastern time, daily). The directories for
	roll call votes (e.g. <tt>data/us/111/rolls</tt>) are updated much more
	frequently. If you need almost-real-time roll call vote data,
	you can rsync that directory hourly.</p>


<h2><a name="schema_people"></a>Schema: people.xml</h2>

<p><a href="/data/us/people.xml">data/us/people.xml</a> lists everyone that has ever served in Congress, and U.S. presidents, with their party affiliation, terms in Congress, birthdays, etc. This file is quite large. This file has been put together from a variety of sources and is maintained by hand. All people in the database are identified by a numeric ID with no particular meaning.</p>

<p><a href="/data/us/111/people.xml">data/us/111/people.xml</a> and similar Congress-specific people.xml files mimic the layout of the full people.xml file but only contain those Members of Congress who have or had a role during that particular Congress and the roles they served in that Congress only.</p>

<p>The format of this file is essentially self-explanatory. Here are the details:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the &lt;person&gt; elements, the only obligatory fields are "id", "firstname", "lastname", and "name". Other fields are omitted if they are not known. "name" is a good field for you to display.</li>
<li>Biographical attributes include "gender" ("M" or "F") and "birthday" (YYYY-MM-DD).</li>
<li>The attributes "bioguideid", "osid", and "pvsid" refer to the ids assigned at <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov">bioguide.congress.gov</a>, the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, and <a href="http://www.votesmart.org">VoteSmart</a>. "youtubeid" and "twitterid" give the name of the official YouTube feed of the person; twitterid gives the person&rsquo;s Twitter screen name. Note that bioguideid will be absent for records for presidents that never served in Congress.</li>
<li>"title", "state", and "district" attributes on each &lt;person&gt; element are set if the person currently has a role in Congress. They are redundant with the information contained in the &lt;role&gt; elements.</li>
<li>&lt;role&gt; elements within each &lt;person&gt; element indicate each elected term in Congress or as President the person has served or is serving. The start and end date of the terms are given in the "startdate" and "enddate" attributes in YYYY-MM-DD format. For senator and representative roles, the dates normally refer to the starting day of the Congressional session and the day of adjournment of the Congressional session to which the Member of Congress was elected (i.e. two-year terms for representatives, six-year terms for senators). But Members that are sworn-in late or resign or die will have those dates.</li>
<li>The "type" attribute on a &lt;role&gt; is "sen" (senator), "rep" (congressman), or "prez" (U.S. president). For senators, the "state" attribute gives their state and a "class" attribute gives their election class (1, 2, or 3). (Senior vs. junior status are not indicated.) For representatives, the "state" attribute gives their state and the "district" attribute gives the congressional district, or 0 for at-large districts and -1 for historical data where the district is not known.</li>
<li>The "party" attribute has the political party of the individual during that term. (When an individual changes parties, it is the most recent party.) The "url" attribute gives the address of the official homepage of the individual at the time the element was created. The "current" attribute is present and set to 1 if the role is current. You can also determine this by looking at the start and end dates, which are in YYYY-MM-DD format.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example record:</p>

    &lt;/person&gt;
...
&lt;/people&gt;
</pre>

<p>In the Congress-specific people.xml file, only the role with the "current" attribute is included.</p>

<h2><a name="schema_votes"></a>Schema: Roll Call Vote Files</h2>
		
<p>Roll call votes can be found in directories such as
<a href="/data/us/111/rolls">data/us/111/rolls</a>.</p>

<p>The files are named as follows: data/us/CCC/rolls/[hs]SSSS-NNN.xml:</p>
<ul>

<li>CCC signifies the Congress number. See the first column of <a href="/data/us/sessions.tsv">data/us/sessions.tsv</a>.
It is a number from 1 to 111 (at the time of writing) and does NOT have
zero-padding.</li>

<li>"h" or "s" signifies whether the vote took place in the House or Senate.</li>

<li>SSSS is the "session" of Congress that the vote took 
place in. Here I mean what is really called a session. Today, 
sessions follow calendar years and are named in GovTrack 
accordingly. So SSSS will be the four-digit year that vote took 
place in. Before the end of World War II, there were usually 
three sessions to Congress and these are labeled either 1, 2, 3 
or with a letter. See the second column of <a href="/data/us/sessions.tsv">data/us/sessions.tsv</a>.
(There is no zero- or space-padding.)</li>

<li>NNN is the roll call number according to the House or 
Senate. There is no zero-padding. The Senate restarts its 
numbering every calendar year, whereas the House restarts its 
numbering after each two-year session.</li>

</ul>

<p>The root element is "roll" and has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <b>where</b> attribute: either &quot;house&quot; or &quot;senate&quot;</li>
	<li> <b>session</b> attribute which contains what GovTrack calls a session but is really the Congress number, e.g. 111</li>
	<li> <b>year</b> attribute: the year the vote took place in (same as in the file name for recent data)</li>
	<li> <b>roll</b> attribute: the number of the vote (same as in the file name)</li>
	<li> <b>datetime</b> attribute: the date and time of the vote, such as &quot;2007-01-04T12:32:00-05:00&quot;. If the time of day is not known, the date will be in YYYY-MM-DD format.</li>
	<li> <b>updated</b> attribute: the date and time the file was updated, same date format as above (but time is always present)</li>
	<li> <b>aye</b>, <b>nay</b>, <b>nv</b>, <b>present</b> attributes: total counts for aye, nay, not voting, and present votes.</li>
	<li> <b>source</b> is either &quot;house.gov&quot;, &quot;senate.gov&quot; or &quot;keithpoole&quot; which refers to data imported from <a href="http://voteview.com/dwnl.htm" class="external text" title="http://voteview.com/dwnl.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there are these elements:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>type</b> element: The type of the vote, taken right from the source data.  Something like &quot;On Passage&quot;. This is suitable for display. It's up to you to scan all of the different values of this element if you want to use it programmatically.</li>
<li> <b>question</b> element: A description of the vote, taken right from the source data. Again, suitable for display, not necessarily processing.</li>
<li> <b>required</b> element: Describes what is required for the vote to pass.  Values can be unknown, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, and QUORUM (if it's a quorum call) but be prepared for other things to show up.
However, this isn't simple to use. For most votes, this means out of the Members voting, so exclude the "voter" elements whose vote is "0". 1/2 means more than 50% of those voting, 2/3 means at least 2/3rds of Members voting, etc. Senate quorum calls, cloture votes, Motions to Waive Rule XXVIII, and XLIV are out of all senators "duly sworn", meaning including those who didn't actually vote: meaning include all voter elements except those with VP=1.</li>
<li> <b>result</b> element: This is a textual element for human consumption, but any of the following substrings indicate a passing vote: &quot;Passed&quot;, &quot;Agreed&quot;, &quot;Confirmed&quot;.  &quot;Failed&quot;, &quot;Defeated&quot;, &quot;Rejected&quot;, and &quot;Not Sustained&quot; indicating a failing vote.</li>
<li> <b>bill</b> element: If this vote is related to a bill (on passage of bill, on a motion related to the bill, on an amendment to the bill, etc.), this node will be present with <b>session</b>, <b>type</b>, and <b>number</b> attributes.</li>
<li> <b>amendment</b> element: If this vote is related to an amendment, this node will be present.  The <b>ref</b> attribute will be either &quot;bill-serial&quot; and the <b>number</b> attribute indicates the ordinal number of the amendment for the bill given in the <b>bill</b> node.  That is, if the <b>number</b> attribute is &quot;5&quot;, the amendment referred to is the 5th amendment to the bill referenced in the <b>bill</b> node.  If <b>ref</b> is &quot;regular&quot;, <b>number</b> contains an identifier of an amendment, such as &quot;s1234&quot;.</li>
<li> <b>option</b> elements: These elements indicate the types of votes that are permitted to be cast. Each vote option has a key and a textual description of the vote cast. The reason for this is primarily that votes in favor can be both Aye and Yea depending on the type of vote, and we want to preserve this info. The keys for normal votes are always "+" (aye/yea), "-" (nay,no), "P" (present but not voting), "0" (zero; absent/not voting). There are also quorum calls and votes to determine the Speaker of the House which have other values.</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally there is a "voter" element for each Member of Congress
who was elligible to vote. There are two oddities here. First,
the Vice President casts tie-breakers in the Senate. The VP has a
voter element just when he casts a tie-breaker. Second, the Speaker
of the House is not required to vote, generally. That means that when
the Speaker abstains in such a vote, he or she is simply omitted
from the roll call, rather than portraying the speaker as having
abstained or missed the vote. (We just do what the House does.)
These elements have the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>id</b> attribute: The GovTrack ID of the person who cast the vote. Can be &quot;0&quot; if the ID of the voter could not be determined (but the node is left in so that the totals are correct).  Also &quot;0&quot; if <b>VP</b> = &quot;1&quot;.</li>
<li> <b>VP</b> attribute.  Set to &quot;1&quot; if the node represents the vote of the vice president in the case of a tie in the Senate.  The <b>id</b> attribute is set to &quot;0&quot;.  Otherwise the attribute is absent.</li>
<li> <b>vote</b> attribute: Generally &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, or &quot;P&quot; indicating an aye, nay, a &quot;no vote&quot; (absence), or a &quot;Present&quot; vote, which is used in quorum calls (and perhaps can show up elsewhere). These correspond to the keys of the vote options, described above.</li>
<li> <b>value</b> attribute: This is a textual name for the actual vote cast, e.g. Aye, Yea, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example file, data/us/111/rolls/h2009-1.xml:</p>

<pre class="code">

<h2><a name="schema_bills"></a>Schema: Bills and Resolutions</h2>

<p>Bills (and resolutions) can be found in directories such as
<a href="/data/us/111/bills">data/us/111/bills</a>.</p>

<p>The files are named as follows: data/us/CCC/rolls/TTTNNN.xml.</p>
<ul>
<li>CCC signifies the Congress number. See the first column of <a href="/data/us/sessions.tsv">data/us/sessions.tsv</a>.
It is a number from 1 to 111 (at the time of writing) and does NOT have
zero-padding.</li>
<li>TTT is the type of bill or resolution from the following codes:
"h" (displayed "H.R." i.e. a House bill), "hr" (displayed "H.Res.", a House resolution),
"hj" (displayed "H.J.Res." i.e. a House joint resolution), "hc" (displayed "H.Con.Res.", i.e.
a House Concurrent Resolution), and similarly "s", "sr", "sj", and "sc" for Senate bills
displayed as "S.", "S.Res.", etc.
See <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/blog/2009/11/11/what-are-the-different-types-of-bills/">this blog post</a> for an explanation of the
types.</li>
<li>NNN is the bill number, without zero-padding.</li>
</ul>

<p>The format of the XML file is:</p> 
<ul><li> <b>bill</b> root element
<ul><li> attributes:
<ul><li> <b>session</b>: The session (i.e. Congress) that this bill is a part of (i.e. 110).</li>
<li> <b>type</b>: The type of the bill (h, hr, hc, etc., as above).</li>
<li> <b>number</b>: The number of the bill.</li>
<li> <b>updated</b>: The date the bill XML file was last updated, such as "2007-01-05T15:30:39-05:00".</li>
</ul> </li>
<li> <b>state</b> element: Contains a value indicating the current status of the bill.  See below.</li>
<li> <b>introduced</b> element: <b>datetime</b> attribute gives the date the bill was introduced.</li>
<li> <b>titles</b> element:
<ul><li> <b>title</b> element, once for each title given to the bill.  The element content has the text of the title.  <b>type</b> attribute is "official", "short", or "popular", and <b>as</b> attribute is the status of the bill in which the title was assigned, such as "introduced".  This is all as given by THOMAS.</li><li> The elements are in the order that they appear in THOMAS, which is chronological order, so the last element tells you the last <b>as</b> status available.</li></ul> </li><li> <b>sponsor</b> element: Most bills have sponsors, and in that case the <b>id</b> attribute is the GovTrack ID of the person sponsoring the bill. Otherwise, a <b>none</b> attribute is set to <b>true</b> if the bill has no sponsor, which has been the case for debt limit raising bills.</li><li> <b>cosponsors</b>:
<ul><li> <b>cosponsor</b> element: Once for each cosponsor. <b>id</b> attribute gives the ID of the cosponsor.  (ID attribute is always present.)</li></ul> </li><li> <b>actions</b>:

<p>The status of the bill is given in a "state" element (think "finite state machine") with the following values:</p>
<ul><li> INTRODUCED. The bill or resolution was introduced but not yet referred to committee.</li><li> REFERRED. The bill or resolution has been referred to committee in the originating chamber and needs committee action to continue.</li><li> REPORTED. The bill or resolution was reported by committee in the originating chamber and can now continue with floor debate in the originating chamber.</li><li> PASS_OVER:. These are a family of status codes indicating the bill or joint or concurrent resolution has passed favorably in its originating chamber and now goes on to the other chamber. If it failed, the status would be the corresponding FAIL:ORIGINATING:.
<ul><li> PASS_OVER:HOUSE. The bill or resolution passed the House (Senate next).</li><li> PASS_OVER:SENATE. The bill or resolution passed the Senate (House next).</li></ul> </li><li> PASSED:. These are a family of status codes indicating the bill has passed favorably out of Congress. It is a final status code for resolutions but not for bills. If the vote that PASSED it had gone the other way, the status would be the corresponding FAIL:ORIGINATING: for PASSED:SIMPLERES or FAIL:SECOND: for the others.
<ul><li> PASSED:SIMPLERES. A simple resolution has been passed in its originating chamber. This is the end of the life for a simple resolution. </li><li> PASSED:CONSTAMEND. A joint resolution which is proposing an amendment to the Constitution has passed both chambers. This is the end of the life for the resolution in the legislative branch. It goes on subsequently to the states.</li><li> PASSED:CONCURRENTRES. A concurrent resolution has been passed by both chambers. This is the end of the life for concurrent resolutions.</li><li> PASSED:BILL. A bill or a joint resolution not proposing an amendment to the constitution has been passed by both chambers. It may require a conference committee first, but will eventually go on to the President.</li></ul> </li><li> PASS_BACK:. These are a family of status codes that occur when a bill is passed in both chambers, but the second chamber made changes that the first chamber now has to agree to. The bill goes to conference or "ping pong" ensues where the chambers go back and forth between passing the bill until no one makes any more changes. When that finishes, the bill goes into the state PASSED:BILL.
<ul><li> PASS_BACK:HOUSE. The House voted on a Senate bill, making changes and sending it back to the Senate.</li><li> PASS_BACK:SENATE. The Senate voted on a House bill, making changes and sending it back to the House.</li></ul> </li><li> PROV_KILL:. These are a family of status codes indicating the bill or resolution is provisionally killed, meaning Congress took some action that would often mean the end of life for it (often enough to warrant a status code) but that it could still recover.
<ul><li> PROV_KILL:SUSPENSIONFAILED. The bill or resolution was brought up "under suspension of the rules" and failed that vote. It could be voted on again. If the vote had passed, the status would be one of PASSED, PASS_OVER, etc.</li><li> PROV_KILL:CLOTUREFAILED. A cloture vote was taken on the bill or resolution and the vote failed, meaning it was successfully filibustered. If the vote had succeeded, no status would be noted.</li><li> PROV_KILL:PINGPONGFAIL. After both chambers have passed a bill or joint/concurrent resolution, if the second chamber made a change the chambers have to resolve their differences. When the second chamber's changes go back to the first chamber for a vote, if the vote fails it's a provisional failure since I think they can try again.</li><li> PROV_KILL:VETO. The bill "PASSED:BILL" out of Congress but was vetoed by the President. A veto can be overridden. This status applies until an override attempt is made. If the bill was signed instead, the ENACTED status would follow (but not immediately). A pocket veto is indicated separately with VETOED:POCKET.</li></ul> </li><li> FAIL:. These are a family of status codes indicating the end of life of a bill or resolution. (Unlike PROVKILL, these are always final.)
<ul><li> FAIL:ORIGINATING:. This is a subgroup for when a bill or resolution fails in its originating chamber.
<ul><li> FAIL:ORIGINATING:HOUSE. The bill or resolution failed in its originating chamber, the House.</li><li> FAIL:ORIGINATING:SENATE. The bill or resolution failed in its originating chamber, the Senate.</li></ul> </li><li> FAIL:SECOND. This is a subgroup for when a bill or joint or concurrent resolution fails in the second chamber. It must have passed in the originating chamber to get this far.
<ul><li> FAIL:SECOND:HOUSE. The bill or resolution passed in the Senate but failed in the House.</li><li> FAIL:SECOND:SENATE. The bill or resolution passed in the House but failed in the Senate.</li></ul> </li></ul> </li><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_PASS_OVER:. This is a family of status codes indicating a veto override attempt was successful in the originating chamber, and that it is now up to the second chamber to attempt the override. If the override failed, the status would be one of VETOED:OVERRIDE_FAIL_ORIGINATING:.
<ul><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_PASS_OVER:HOUSE. The House (the originating chamber) succeeded at the veto override. It goes on to the Senate next.</li><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_PASS_OVER:SENATE. The Senate (the originating chamber) succeeded at the veto override. It goes on to the House next.</li></ul> </li><li> VETOED:. These are a family of status codes indicating the end of life for a bill that has been vetoed. It is a final status code for a bill.
<ul><li> VETOED:POCKET. This status code is for bills that were pocket-vetoed, meaning the President does not sign the bill and Congress adjourns. The bill does not become law and Congress has no opportunity to override.</li><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_FAIL_ORIGINATING:. This is a subgroup for bills who failed in the veto-override attempt of its originating chamber, which comes first.
<ul><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_FAIL_ORIGINATING:HOUSE. Veto override failed in the House, the bill's originating chamber. It had not gotten to the Senate yet for an override.</li><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_FAIL_ORIGINATING:SENATE. Veto override failed in the Senate, the bill's originating chamber. It had not gotten to the House yet for an override.</li></ul> </li><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_FAIL_SECOND::. This is a subgroup for bills whose veto was successfully overridden in its originating chamber but failed in the veto-override attempt of the other chamber, which comes second. If the override had passed, the status would shortly be ENACTED:VETO_OVERRIDE.
<ul><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_FAIL_SECOND:HOUSE. Veto override passed in the Senate (the originating chamber) but failed in the House.</li><li> VETOED:OVERRIDE_FAIL_SECOND:SENATE. Veto override passed in the House (the originating chamber) but failed in the Senate.</li></ul> </li></ul> </li><li> ENACTED:. These are a family of status codes for bills and joint resolutions not proposing an amendment to the constitution that have been enacted as law. It comes after a short delay between the signature or override and the administrative action to actually make the bill law.
<ul><li> ENACTED:SIGNED. The president signed the bill.</li><li> ENACTED:VETO_OVERRIDE. The bill was vetoed but the veto was overridden in both chambers.</li></ul> </li></ul>
