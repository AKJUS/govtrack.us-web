	<h1>Bulk Raw Data Documentation</h1>
	<p>GovTrack&rsquo;s bulk raw data can be used to build other tools around Congressional information.</p>
	<p>Our bulk data rsync server provides access to most of the information found on GovTrack. Data for the 113th Congress (2013 and on) are from <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">github:unitedstates/congress-legislators</a> and <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">github:unitedstates/congress</a>, community projects that we helped create and now help maintain. Historical data is from our legacy scrapers.</p>
	<p>Consider using our <a href="/developers/api">API</a> if you only need a small slice of the data.</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
	<p>The bulk data is a deep directory structure of flat XML and JSON files. The directory layout is described below.</p>
	
	<h3>Try HTTP First</h3>
	
	<p>You can familiarize yourself with the contents of our bulk data by browsing <a 	href="/data/congress/">http://www.govtrack.us/data/congress/</a>. Get an idea for the directory structure and what the files look like.</p>
	
	<h3>Basic Directory Layout</h3>
	
	<p>Our files are in three main directories:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/data/congress-legislators/">/data/congress-legislators/</a><br>
		Information on Members of Congress from 1789-present, presidents and vice presidents, Congressional committees, and current committee assignments. This data is a mirror of the files in <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">github:unitedstates/congress-legislators</a>.</li>

		<li><a href="/data/congress/">/data/congress/</a> (i.e. http://www.govtrack.us/data/congress/)<br>
		Bill status and other legislative data from 2013 (113th Congress) and forward. This data is the output of the scrapers developed by the <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">github:unitedstates/congress</a> project.</li>
		
		<li><a href="/data/us/">/data/us/</a><br>
		Bill status and other legislative data from 1789-2012 (1st-112th Congresses). These files come from our legacy scrapers and are no longer being updated.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>More information on these directories can be found below.</p>
	
	<h3>Getting the Data</h3>
	
	<p>To fetch the data we support <tt>rsync</tt>, a common Unix/Mac tool for efficiently fetching files and keeping them updated as they change. The root of our rsync tree is <tt>govtrack.us::govtrackdata</tt>, and this corresponds exactly to what you see at <a 
	href="/data/">http://www.govtrack.us/data/</a>.</p>
	
	<p>To download bill data for the 113th Congress into a local directory named bills, run:</p>
	
	<pre>rsync -avz --delete --delete-excluded --exclude **/text-versions/ \
		govtrack.us::govtrackdata/congress/113/bills .</pre>
	
	<p>(Note the double colons in the middle and the period at the end. This is a long command. I&rsquo;ve indicated the line continuation with a backslash.)</p>
	
	<p>This directory will grow as bills are introduced, and files will be updated regularly as we pull new information from Congress. To keep your files fresh, just run the command again. It will only download new and updated files!</p>
	
	<p>The complete data directory is around 100 gigabytes in all, so keep your rsync command as narrowly focused as possible.</p>
	
	<p>Although you can also see these files over HTTP, we discourage using HTTP to actually download the data in bulk. Use it for a few files, but don&rsquo;t hammer our server with tens of thousands of HTTP requests.</p>
	
	<p>For more info about rsync, see <a href="/developers/rsync">our rsync notes</a> and the <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/rsync.html">rsync documentation</a>.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em">Directory Layout</h2>
	
	<h3>Know what a &ldquo;Congress&rdquo; is!</h3>
	
	<p>Most files are organized by &ldquo;Congress.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Congress&rdquo; 
	is a two-year term of activity, starting in the year after an 
	election year. Many things in Congress reset after each two year 
	term, such as bill numbers. Each year is called a &ldquo;session&rdquo;.
	(In historical data, the durations of sessions and Congresses were more arbitrary.)</p>
	
	<p>Congresses start and end on January 3 of odd-numbered years. The 113<sup>th</sup> Congress
	started on Jan 3, 2013 at noon and will end on Jan 3, 2015 at noon. (Again, in historical
	data the start and end dates of Congresses was more arbitrary.)</p>
	
	<h3>Directories</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><tt><a href="/data/congress-legislators/">/data/congress-legislators/</a></tt><br>
		This directory contains several files in YAML format containing information on Members of Congress from 1789-present, presidents and vice presidents, Congressional committees, and current committee assignments. See the documentation at <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">github:unitedstates/congress-legislators</a> for details.</li>

		<li><tt><a href="/data/congress/113/bills">/data/congress/113/bills</a>/[bill_type]/[bill_type][bill_number]/data.[json|xml]</tt><br>
		Bill and resolution status for bills in the 113th Congress. See the <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">github:unitedstates/congress</a> project documentation for details of the JSON format. The XML format is backwards-compatible with our legacy bill XML files (<a href="/developers/bill_xml">documentation</a>).</li>
		
		<li><tt><a href="/data/congress/113/bills/sconres/sconres14/text-versions/is/">/data/congress/113/bills</a>/[bill_type]/[bill_type][bill_number]/<b>text-versions</b>/[version]</tt><br>
		Bill and resolution text and text metadata for a particular bill. Note that while we only have bill status data for the 113th Congress and forward in this area of the data directory, we have bill text metadata going back much further (see our <a href="/about">coverage table</a> for details). See the <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">github:unitedstates/congress</a> project documentation for details.</li>

		<li><tt><a href="/data/congress/113/amendments">/data/congress/113/amendments</a>/[amdt_type]/[amdt_type][amdt_number]/data.[json|xml]</tt><br>
		Amendment status for amendments to bills in the 113th Congress. See the <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">github:unitedstates/congress</a> project documentation for details of the JSON format. The XML format is backwards-compatible with our legacy amendment XML files.</li>

		<li><tt><a href="/data/congress/113/votes">/data/congress/113/votes</a>/[session]/[chamber][number]/data.[json|xml]</tt><br>
		Roll call vote results for the 113th Congress. See the <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">github:unitedstates/congress</a> project documentation for details of the JSON format. The XML format is backwards-compatible with our legacy roll call vote XML files (<a href="/developers/vote_xml">documentation</a>).</li>
	
		<li><tt><a href="/data/us/112/bills">/data/us/[congress]/bills</a></tt><br>
		Historical bill and resolution status from the 93rd to the 112th Congress. <a href="/developers/bill_xml">Bill XML Schema &gt;</a></li>
		
		<li><tt><a href="/data/us/112/rolls">/data/us/[congress]/rolls</a></tt><br>
		Historical roll call vote results for the 1st through 112th Congress. See our <a href="/about">coverage table</a> for where this data came from. Note that votes by unanimous consent and other similar unrecorded vote types are not included here because they are not recorded votes. <a href="/developers/vote_xml">Roll Call Vote XML Schema &gt;</a> </li>

		<li><tt><a href="/data/us/sessions.tsv">/data/us/sessions.tsv</a></tt><br>
		A TSV file containing the start and adjournment dates of each Congress and session.</li>
	
		<li><tt><a href="/data/photos">/data/photos</a></tt><br>
		Contains jpeg images of Members of Congress, past and present. 
		Not all Members of Congress's have photos. The name of the photo is the GovTrack 
		numeric identifier for the person followed by: nothing, for the 
		largest original image available; 200px, 100px, 50px, for three 
		sizes of the photo, by width; all followed by .jpeg. -credit.txt files
		give a tab-delimeted source URL and source description information
		for each photo.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Other files that you may see in the /data directory are unsupported. Use at your own risk.</p>
