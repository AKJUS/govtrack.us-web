   North Carolina&rsquo;s congressional districts are changing &mdash; do NOT use this page when planning your vote for the 2020 election.
   </strong>

   If you are looking for information about who will be on your 2020
   North Carolina
   ballot, that&rsquo;s not information we provide. Please consult your
   local elections authority.

   But your representative in Congress has not yet changed.
   That happens after the 2020 winners take office on Jan. 3, 2021.
   Therefore if you are looking <strong>for who represents you now, our map below
   is correct</strong>.
