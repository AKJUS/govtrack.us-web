   North Carolina&rsquo;s congressional districts have changed for the 2020 election,
   but the representatives-elect don&rsquo;t take office yet.
   </strong>

   If you are looking for information about who was on your 2020
   North Carolina ballot or the districts newly elected representatives
   will be serving, we don&rsquo;t have that information yet.

   But your representative in Congress has not yet changed.
   That happens after the 2020 winners take office on Jan. 3, 2021.
   Therefore if you are looking <strong>for who represents you now, our map below
   remains correct</strong>.
