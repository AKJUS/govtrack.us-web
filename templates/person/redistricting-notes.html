   Pennsylvania&rsquo;s congressional districts changed for the 2018 elections. But the newly elected
   representatives have not yet taken office &mdash; that happens on January 3, 2019 at noon. Consequently,
   if you want to look up who still represents you in Congress now, use our map below which is based on
   the 2016 congressional districts. If you want to know who will represent you beginning on January 3,
