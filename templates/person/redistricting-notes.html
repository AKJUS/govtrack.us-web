   <strong>About district changes:</strong>
   North Carolina&rsquo;s congressional districts have changed for the 2020 election.
   But this <strong>does not</strong> mean that your representative in Congress has changed.
   That happens only once the 2020 winners take office on Jan. 3, 2021.
   <strong>If you are looking for who represents you <em>now</em>, our map below
   is the correct map to use.</strong> It is the 2018 district map.
   If you are looking for information about your 2020
   North Carolina
   ballot, that&rsquo;s not information we provide. Please consult your
   local elections authority.
