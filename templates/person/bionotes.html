      <p>In 2023, Trump associates and top advisors pleaded guilty to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/politics/kenneth-chesebro-georgia-election-subversion/index.html">submitting a fraudulent slate of electors to Congress from Georgia</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/24/jenna-ellis-plea-deal-georgia/">making false statements</a> about purported widespread fraud in the election, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/19/pro-trump-lawyer-sidney-powell-pleads-guilty-georgia-election-interference-case/">tampering with voting machines after the election</a>, admitted in civil court to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fake-pro-trump-electors-settle-wisconsin-civil-lawsuit-admit-attempt-to-overturn-biden-win">posing as fake electors in Wisconsin</a>, and were convicted of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/09/07/peter-navarro-guilty-contempt/">contempt of Congress for withholding documents during its investigation</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/03/politics/federico-klein-trump-state-department-january-6-us-capitol/index.html">assaulting police officers at the Capitol</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump associates and top advisors are also currently facing charges for submitting fraudulent slates of electors to Congress in 2021 in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/18/1188437637/michigans-fake-elector-charges">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/06/nevada-fake-electors-indictment-trump/">Nevada</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1236998675/arizona-fake-elector-charges">Arizona</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-fake-electors-trump-2020-charges-77d00919fc8d8e07438076610090a9b1">Wisconsin</a>.</p>
      <p>During the deadly January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol</a> which attempted to prevent &mdash; and did delay &mdash; Congress&#39;s certification of the election, Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-video-statement-on-capitol-protesters/587285">told the rioters &quot;we love you&quot;</a> and later called it a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnxej1dn0o">&quot;day of love&quot;</a>. The riot was <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/84551/important-elements-of-the-january-6th-report/">led on the front lines by militant white supremacy groups</a> members of which were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/us/politics/oath-keepers-trial-verdict-jan-6.html">convicted of sedition</a>. The Senate&#39;s top Republican at the time said Trump was <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-votes-to-acquit-trump-for-role-in-capitol-attack">&quot;practically and morally responsible&quot;</a> for the riot, and he faced impeachment in Congress for his actions (see below). In 2025, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/20/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants/">pardoned</a> hundreds of January 6 rioters convicted of assault, property destruction, and sedition.</p>
      <p>Prior to Congress&#39;s certification of the election, Trump&#39;s campaign and Trump-aligned groups launched <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/dec/10/donald-trump-has-lost-dozens-election-lawsuits-her/">countless lawsuits throughout the country</a> seeking to disenfranchise large swaths of voters, and in some cases entire states, who supported his opponent. Many claims were readily debunked in and out of court, and nearly all of the lawsuits failed. 126 Republican legislators in Congress joined one of the cases, which was before the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/162953/20201207234611533_TX-v-State-Motion-2020-12-07%20FINAL.pdf">calling for all the votes for president to be discarded in four states that Trump narrowly lost</a>. In the case, Republicans proffered lies about illegal voting and a novel legal theory about states&#39; rights which the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121120zr_p860.pdf">rejected</a>. Following the rejection of several related cases before the Supreme Court, one legislator who joined the case <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1345377936300453891">called for violence</a>. And on January 6, 2021, in the hours after the riot at the Capitol, 147 Republican legislators <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/compare/7/2021-coup-attempt">voted to conclude the election without the certified electors</a> from two states Trump narrowly lost. The vote failed, as did the other efforts to change the outcome of the election. These events were unprecedented.</p>

      <p><b>No one is above the law</b></p>
      <p><i>Legislators in Congress are frequently investigated for misconduct, which we track in our <a href="/misconduct">Legislator Misconduct Database</a>. Presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts.</i></p>
      <p>Trump faced federal charges under the Espionage Act in 2023 for mishandling and failing to return classified documents found at his resort after he left office in 2021, but the prosecution was terminated shortly after he won re-election. It is Department of Justice policy not to prosecute its ultimate boss, the President.</p>
      <p>He was also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-hush-money-verdict.html">convicted in state court in 2024 for the felony of falsifying business records to cover up acts</a> that he believed might have hurt him in the 2016 election. In 2023 a civil jury found that Trump sexually abused an acquaintance and ordered Trump to pay her $88.3 million in damages.</p>

      <p><b>Impeachments</b></p>
      <p>Trump was the third president to face, and be acquitted by, an impeachment trial by Congress. He was the first president to be impeached twice and the first president who had senators in their own party vote to remove them from office:</p>
      <p>In a July 25, 2019 phone call, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">President Trump asked Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy for a “favor”</a> to investigate his expected 2020 election rival Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory related to the 2016 election, and to coordinate the investigations with Trump’s personal lawyer. It was later found that the Trump Administration <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564">illegally withheld security assistance funds for Ukraine</a> and a White House visit, and a Trump Administration official said that Ukraine was told that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-key-impeachment-witness-just-changed-his-story-on-the-ukraine-quid-pro-quo/">the aid was conditioned on the investigation</a>. The House of Representatives impeached President Trump on Dec. 18, 2019, charging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for withholding aid to Ukraine in exchange for political favors and then refusing to provide information during Congress&rsquo;s investigation (<a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_trump-ukraine_impeachment_inquiry_report.pdf">report</a>; <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h695">230-197 vote on abuse of power</a>; <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h696">229-198 vote on obstruction of Congress</a>). The Senate conducted a trial in January and February 2020, and on Feb. 5, 2020, the Senate voted to acquit Trump on both charges with a majority of senators voting for acquittal (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2020/s33">52-48 vote on abuse of power</a> and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2020/s34">53-47 vote on obstruction of Congress</a>). <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/514/2019-12-18_president-donald-trump-impeached-for-abuse-of-power-and-obstruction-related-to-seeking-political-favors-from-ukraine">More details &raquo;</a></p>
      <p>The House of Representatives impeached Trump a second time on January 13, 2021 for a pattern of &ldquo;efforts to subvert and obstruct&rdquo; the completion of the 2020 election and &ldquo;inciting violence,&rdquo; referring to the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol that sought to prevent Congress from determining that Trump had lost the election (<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/house_judiciary_committee_report_-_materials_in_support_of_h._res._24.pdf?utm_campaign=4640-519">report</a>; <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/117-2021/h17">232-197 vote</a>). On February 13, 2021 the Senate voted to acquit President Trump with most senators voting to convict Trump of the charges but short of the two-thirds threshold required to convict (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/117-2021/s59">57-43 vote</a>). Trump had already left office by that point, but a conviction could have barred him from returning to office.</p>

      <p><b>Conflicts of interest</b></p>
      <p><i>Legislators in Congress are required to avoid the most serious conflicts of interest and often face consequences for not doing so, which we track in our <a href="/misconduct">Legislator Misconduct Database</a>. No such rules apply to the President.</i></p>
      <p>Trump and his family&#39;s financial investments and dealings create a dizzying array of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/17/us/politics/trump-conflicts-of-interest.html">conflicts of interest</a> with policies that he will have a hand in as president. Recent investments and deals include real estate and luxury hotels in the Middle East tied to foreign nations, cryptocurrency, his media company Truth Social, and branding deals with bibles and other products. And his prior investments, primarily in real estate, are around the world. His family members are a part of venture capital and private equity firms directing investments in numerous other companies. His advisor and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/politics/elon-musk-trump-campaign-finance-filings/index.html">financial backer</a> Elon Musk is the richest person in the world thanks in part to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-11-14/elon-musk-conflicts-of-interest">tens of billions of dollars from the government</a> going to his companies.

      <p>President Johnson was impeached by the House but found not guilty by the Senate in 1868 during the aftermath of the Civil War

      However, the Tenure of Office Act was repealed two decades later, and in 1926 the Supreme Court ruled that a similar limit on
      the power of the President to remove appointees was unconstitutional, calling into question the validity of the impeachment.
