		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> The statistics on this page were last updated on {{publishdate|date}}. {{meta.notes}}</p>

		{% if not meta.is_full_congress_stats %}
		<p><strong>Legislative Year:</strong> &ldquo;{{session}}&rdquo; refers to the legislative year that began on {{meta.startdate|date}} and ended on {{meta.enddate|date}}. We only compare each legislator to other Members of Congress serving in the same chamber on {{meta.enddate|date}}.</p>

		<p><strong>Ranking Members (RkMembs):</strong> The chair of a committee is always selected from the political party that holds the most seats in the chamber, called the &ldquo;majority party&rdquo;. The &ldquo;ranking member&rdquo; (sometimes &ldquo;RkMembs&rdquo;) is the title given to the senior-most member of the committee <em>not</em> in the majority party.</p>
		<p><strong>Safe vs Competitive:</strong> Safe and competitive House seats are as listed in the <a href="http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings">Cook Political Report</a> as of December 18, 2013.</p>
		<p><strong>Freshmen/Sophomores:</strong> Freshmen and sophomores refer to Members of Congress that did not serve in the previous Congress or that served no earlier than the previous Congress, respectively, and in the same chamber as they were at the end of {{period}}.</p>
		<p><strong>Joint Resolutions:</strong> When counting laws, we also include joint resolutions that are enacted.</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker&rsquo;s Votes:</strong> Missed votes are not computed for the Speaker of the House. According to <a href="http://www.rules.house.gov/singlepages.aspx?NewsID=160&rsbd=165">current House rules</a>, the Speaker of the House is not required to vote in &ldquo;ordinary legislative proceedings.&rdquo; In practice this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes but is not considered absent.</p>
		<p><strong>Bipartisan Bills:</strong> When computing statistics for Writing Bipartisan Bills, we included only Members of Congress who sponsored more than 10 bills. Similarly for Joining Bipartisan Bills, we included Members of Congress who cosponsored more than 10 bills.</p>
		<p><strong>Leadership/Ideology:</strong> The leadership and ideology scores are not displayed for Members of Congress who introduced fewer than 10 bills, or, for ideology, for Members of Congress that have a low leadership score, as there is usually not enough data in these cases to compute reliable leadership and ideology statistics.</p>
		<p><strong>Transparency Bills:</strong> We identified <a href="https://github.com/govtrack/govtrack.us-web/blob/master/analysis/transparency-bills.txt">20 bills (12 House bills and 8 Senate bills)</a> that improve access to government records and are on subjects that we believe are non-partisan.</p>
