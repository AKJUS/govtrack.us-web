	<h1>Members of Congress</h1>
	
	<p>The United States Congress has an upper chamber called the Senate and a lower chamber called the House of Representatives (or &ldquo;House&rdquo; for short) which share the responsibilities of the legislative process.</p>
	
	<h2>The 2012 Election</h2>
	
	<p>NOTE: The new Members of Congress just elected take office in early January. You won&rsquo;t see any changes due to the elections on GovTrack until then.</p>
	
	<h2>The Senate</h2>
	
	<p>The 50 states elect 2 senators each for staggered 6-year terms. A senator represents between 1 and 37 million people, depending on their state&rsquo;s population.</p>
	
	<p>The day-to-day activities of the Senate are controlled largely by the political party holding the most seats, called the &ldquo;majority party.&ldquo;   Here is a count of senators by party:</p>
		
	<div style="float: right; width: 260px; margin-top: 1em;">
		<label for="state">Find Senators by State:</label>
		<select id="state" onchange="if (this.value != '') window.location='/congress/members/' + this.value">

	{% endfor %}
	{% if senate_vacancies > 0 %}<tr><th>Vacancies</th> <td>{{senate_vacancies}}</td></tr>{% endif %}
	<tr><th>Total</th> <td>100</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">The House of Representatives</h2>
	
	<p>The country is also divided into 435 congressional districts with a population of about 710,000 each. Each district elects a representative (aka congressperson) to the House for a 2-year term. Here is a count of representatives by party:</p>

	<p>As in the Senate, the day-to-day activities of the House are controlled by the political party holding the most seats, called the &ldquo;majority party.&ldquo;   Here is a count of congresspeople by party:</p>

	<tr><th>Total</th> <td>435</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p style="margin-top: .5em">In addition, the District of Columbia and the U.S.&rsquo;s island territories elect a total of 6 delegates to the House with limited voting privileges. Puerto Rico&rsquo;s delegate is called the Resident Commissioner.</p>
	
	<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Congressional Sessions</h2>
	
	<p>Congress works in two-year sessions tied to the elections. Each session is actually called a Congress and begins in the January of the year following an election.</p>
	
	<p>We are currently in the {{congress_current.0|ordinal}} Congress which began on {{congress_current.1|date}}. The {{congress_previous.0|ordinal}} Congress ended on {{congress_previous.1|date}}.</p>
