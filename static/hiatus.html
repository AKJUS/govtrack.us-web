      <p>The United States Constitution does not say that elections must be fair. For most of the history of the United States,
      voting by Black people, indigenous people, women, and poor people was not legal. There were no direct elections for senators.
      People in territories acquired through war are neither represented in Congress nor permitted to vote for President &mdash; some are not considered
      U.S. citizens. Residents of the capital district are not represented in Congress even though it has final say over their laws.
      The principle of democracy that every vote matters equally is, of course, not fulfilled in the Electoral College or representation in the Senate, which were defined by an original
      compromise that endorsed slavery and transformed later by the politicization of the admission of states to the Union; politicization
      of the drawing of congressional districts has had a similar effect. Some of this wasn&rsquo;t fair &mdash; but there has been peace.
      Some of this still isn&rsquo;t fair &mdash; but it is the law.</p>

      <p>This is a country of laws first, fairness second. We follow laws today and make them fair tomorrow. We persuade minds and activate
      voters to make a more perfect union through peace. There is no <em>if</em>.</p>

      <p>On January 20, 2021 at noon, the term of the President of the United States will end &mdash; fair or not.
      The opportunity to make it fair will come again.</p>

      <p>Our mission cannot be fulfilled when faithful execution of the law is replaced with an ultimatum for something
      that does not and has never existed. We have hit pause.</p>
