<p>Dear GovTrack Users,</p>

<p>GovTrack would like your help to keep Congress open and accountable.</p>

<p>We have launched a Kickstarter to fund unbiased reporting of congressional legislation and activity. If we can reach our goal of $35,000 we’ll be able to keep posting bill summaries and daily reports for the next 6 months, which we began doing earlier this summer. And at our stretch goal of $60,000 we’ll be able to explain every vote that Congress takes. The more funding we have the more we can cover and the longer we can do it for. If every GovTrack user gave just one dollar, our project would be funded.</p>

<p>Please head over to our Kickstarter page:</p>

<p>and support us however you can. We’ll only be able to keep this going with the support of GovTrack users.</p>

<p>As you may know, for the past two months GovTrack has been working to add a reporting side to the website. This has included the new GovTrack Insider reports on the activity of Congress as well as summaries of bills, which we have been including in email updates, all to make it as easy as possible for users like you to stay informed about your government. Now, as Congress’ summer session comes to an end, we’d like to ask for your help to continue our work.</p>

<p>Thank you for using GovTrack,
<br>The GovTrack Team</p>
