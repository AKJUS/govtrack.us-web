	<p>What do you think, should GovTrack hire a researcher to look deeper into what Congress does each day?</p>

	<hr>

	<p>This summer we had an intern write bill summaries and daily digests of legislative activity on GovTrack Insider. His <a href="https://medium.com/govtrack-insider/congress-s-summer-session-a-recap-9100910f714">recap of Congress’s summer session</a> is a great example of how a researcher can help us all track Congress.</p>

	<p><strong>Already 713 of your Congress-tracking peers have pledged $29,380 to help us hire a full-time researcher. But we need to reach our goal of $35,000 in the next 9 days or we get nothing.</strong></p>

	<p>If you answered YES to whether we should hire a researcher . . .</p>

	<p><a href="http://kck.st/1gZOS2V">Please click here to support our work &raquo;</a></p>

	<p>If you pledge $100, you will get an invitation to a small group chat with the GovTrack team to discuss how to use GovTrack, how the legislative process works, and how to be the best advocate for your issue in Congress. There are rewards for $66 and $35 contributions too.</p>
