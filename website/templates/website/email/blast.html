            <p>Hello and thank you for using GovTrack.us.</p>

            <p>Users often ask us to summarize the bills in Congress, so earlier this summer we added a researcher to our team to do just that. The new bill summaries have appeared in your email updates, on the new <a href="https://medium.com/govtrack-insider">GovTrack
            Insider</a>, and on the GovTrack website.</p>

            <p>If you think we should keep writing summaries of bills, we need
                your help.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
            <p>Will you support GovTrack today by contributing $250, $100, or $50?</p>

            <p>We <a
                  href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872382405/govtrack-insider">launched
                  a Kickstarter</a> to fund our unbiased reporting of
                congressional legislation and Congress’s daily activity. Please follow the link below to support us:</p>

            </div>    
          
            <p>We’ll only be able to keep the new researcher on staff with the support of
                GovTrack users like you.</p>
            
            <p>If we can reach our goal of raising $35,000 we’ll
                be able to keep posting bill summaries and daily reports
                for the next 6 months. We've raised <a
                  href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872382405/govtrack-insider">$5,170
                  so far</a>. This is the first time in 11 years that we’ve asked
                GovTrack users for help like this.</p>
            
            <p>As you may know, for the past two months GovTrack
                has been working to add a reporting side to the website.
                This has included the new <a
                  href="https://medium.com/govtrack-insider">GovTrack
                  Insider</a> reports on the activity of Congress as
                well as <a
                  href="https://www.govtrack.us/events/bill-summaries">summaries
                  of bills</a>, which we have been including in email
                updates, all to make it as easy as possible for users
                like you to stay informed about your government. Now, as
                Congress’s summer session comes to an end, we’d like to
                ask for <a
                  href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872382405/govtrack-insider">your
                  help</a> to continue this work.</p>
