Are you getting the most out of GovTrack? GovTrack has a variety of tools for tracking Congress, new and old. But with 
so much information readily available it can be hard to know what’s out there. That’s why we’re providing weekly tips 
on how to get the most out of GovTrack in your regular email update. Today, we’d like to show our page on 
Congressional Committees, where we briefly explain the role of each committee.

**More on Congressional Committees**

Typically, when a bill is introduced it must first be referred to and reviewed by a Congressional Committee before it 
can be voted on. Each committee has jurisdiction over certain topics of legislation, but with the broad range of 
legislation that gets introduced, jurisdiction is not always so clear. Committee referrals can be telling of the 
subject matter, urgency, and likelihood of passage for a bill. Our [committees page](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/)
briefly explains the jurisdiction of each committee.
