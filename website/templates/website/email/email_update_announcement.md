The sole hearing on the Graham-Cassidy health care bill is today at 2 p.m. EDT --- see below.

### Major Revision

Late Sunday night, sponsors released a substantially revised version of the legislation (as well as detailed analyses) to lobbyists who then shared it with journalists. [NBC's story](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/new-version-graham-cassidy-health-bill-adds-sweeteners-alaska-n804391) linked to the detailed analyses shared last night with lobbyists, but right now those links generate "file not found" errors. [Axios](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4059775-Graham-Cassidy-Revised.html)' and [Politico](http://static.politico.com/27/f7/88bee3c542cd879acbb65d2d0766/gc-amendments.pdf)'s copies of the new revision are still available.

The new version will make the limited CBO analysis expected on Wednesday now obsolete.

Effects of the revisions are hotly contested. Overall, the new version leaves the basic initial structure in place: ACA funding distribution is still replaced with lower & capped block grants to states. However, sponsors say that [the new version increases funds](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/24/16359332/graham-cassidy-revised-billions-funding-alaska) to states whose senators lean no (KY, AZ and AK in particular) while critics say that when all the changes are taken into account the bill is still a loss in federal funds for those same states.

No consensus yet on the meaning and effects of other aspects of the revision.
