Are you getting the most out of GovTrack? With so much information 
readily available it can be hard to know what’s out there. That’s why 
we’re providing weekly tips on how to get the most out of GovTrack in 
your regular email update. **Today, we’d like to talk about GovTrack
stakeholder position statements.**

Stakeholders of legislation, such as policy advocates and think tanks,
are invited to post statements on any bill on GovTrack. If a verified
stakeholder has posted a statement on a bill, it will appear in a section
just below the bill’s sponsor and status.

**How to register as a stakeholder:** [Find the bill](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/)
that your organization has a position on. Bill pages now have the option to
register your organization’s position at the top of the page. GovTrack staff
review statements before they appear on the site.
