*GovTrack Needs Your Help*

Earlier this summer we launched [GovTrack Insider](https://medium.com/govtrack-insider), where we've been posting summaries of legislation and daily briefings on recent activity in Congress. You may have seen the summaries in your email updates.

Now we need your help to keep it going. We've already raised $23,966 for hiring a full time legislative researcher.

If you'd like to see more bill summaries in your email updates, help us reach our $35,000 goal by [backing our work at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872382405/govtrack-insider](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872382405/govtrack-insider?utm_campaign=govtrackemailupdate).
