The House Republican tax reform bill, [H.R. 1](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1), is expected to [head to a vote tomorrow](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/us/politics/tax-plan-senate-obamacare-individual-mandate-trump.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news). The bill would dramatically reduce corporate and individual income taxes and would [increase the deficit by $1.7 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53297) over 10 years --- possibly offset by [$338 billion](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53300) saved by repealing the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate.  

Here are some key facts about what it would do, and how you can take action. 

## Impact on Corporations  

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1, follows the standard Republican philosophy of trickle-down economics. It includes what would be [the largest corporate tax cuts in United States history](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WM_TCJA_PolicyHighlights.pdf), intended to incentivize corporations to spend and hire more in the United States. Here are some of the ways H.R. 1 would lower taxes on corporations:  

* The bill would [lower the corporate tax rate from the current 35% to 20%](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WM_TCJA_PolicyHighlights.pdf) -- the largest corporate tax reduction in U.S. history -- starting in 2019\.
* It would switch the U.S. to a "[territorial tax system](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/territorial-vs-worldwide-taxation)" that taxes corporations based on domestic income only rather than worldwide income. So that 20% would not include any money made overseas. ([Fortune](http://fortune.com/2017/11/02/gop-tax-plan-business-wins/))
* It would eliminate the "[Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)](https://www.aicpastore.com/Content/media/PRODUCER_CONTENT/Newsletters/Articles_2014/CorpTax/CorporateAlternativeMinimumTax.jsp)," which prevents companies that are making more than $7.5 million every three years from reducing their tax rate below a certain level. ([Ways and Means](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WM_TCJA_PolicyHighlights.pdf))
* The bill would also eliminate the [domestic manufacturing deduction](http://greenwaltcpas.com/2010/10/what-is-the-section-199-deduction/) and some other business credits. ([EY](https://taxnews.ey.com/news/2017-1908-senate-tax-reform-proposal-and-house-markup-significantly-affect-accounting-methods-section-199-research-and-development-incentives-and-similar-provisions))

## Impact on Individuals and Families

The bill would lower taxes for most people across all income levels, but in the newest Senate version the tax cuts for individuals [would expire in 2025](https://www.axios.com/senate-gop-releases-new-version-of-tax-bill-2509516903.html). House Republicans boast that under their plan a family of four earning $59,000 (the median household income) [would get a $1,182 tax cut](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WM_TCJA_PolicyHighlights.pdf). This would come from a rate reduction from 15% to 12% for such families --- but the details are still being worked out and [some individuals will see their taxes rise](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/economy/middle-class-tax.html). The full tax bracket threshold amounts of the House bill can be found in [the bill text here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1/text/ih#link=I_A_1001_a_~Q1_1_b&nearest=HB6644457673843D29882C7CA6BED071A). Here are some more ways H.R. 1 would lower taxes on individuals and families:  

* It would eliminate the AMT for individuals and families, meaning that individuals could potentially reduce their tax rate significantly, even to zero, via exemptions and deductions. ([Ways and Means](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WM_TCJA_PolicyHighlights.pdf)) This change would [mostly affect taxpayers making $200,000 to $500,000](https://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/who-is-most-affected-by-the-alternative-minimum-tax). 
* It would double the inherited wealth exempt from the estate tax from $5.5 million to $11 million for six years, and then after that it would eliminate the tax entirely. ([Ways and Means](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WM_TCJA_PolicyHighlights.pdf))
* It would nearly double the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. ([NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/27/us/politics/six-charts-to-explain-the-republican-tax-plan.html))  

The [Senate version](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/11.14.17%20Chairman's%20Modified%20Mark.pdf) of the bill will also include a [repeal of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act](http://www.businessinsider.com/gop-tax-bill-obamacare-mandate-trump-rand-paul-2017-11). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that doing so would [increase the number of uninsured Americans by 4 million in 2019 and 13 million in 2027](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53300) but reduce federal deficits by about $338 billion over ten years.
