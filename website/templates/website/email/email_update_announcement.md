*We have 10 days left*

Earlier this summer we launched [GovTrack Insider](https://medium.com/govtrack-insider), where we've been posting summaries of legislation and daily briefings on recent activity in Congress. You may have seen the summaries in your email updates.

We've raised $28,113 to hire a full time legislative researcher. But we need to reach our goal of $35,000 in the next 10 days or we get nothing and GovTrack Insider ends.

If you'd like to see more bill summaries in your email updates, help us hire a researcher by [backing our work at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872382405/govtrack-insider](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1872382405/govtrack-insider).
