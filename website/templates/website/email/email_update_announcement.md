Are you getting the most out of GovTrack? GovTrack has a variety of tools for tracking Congress, new and old. But with so much information 
readily available it can be hard to know what’s out there. That’s why we’re providing weekly tips on how to get the most out of GovTrack in your 
regular email update. Today, we’d like to show where to find advocates’ ratings of your representatives.

## About Advocacy Scorecards

Legislative advocates often put out congressional scorecards to rate their approval of each member of Congress. These scores are typically based 
on how members vote on a given issue or set of issues the advocate cares about, so they can give a good idea of where your representatives stand. 
GovTrack currently displays scores from eleven organizations in the analysis section of members’ pages.

Check out a live example on the page for [Rep. Devin Nunes](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/devin_nunes/400297).

Scores from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and NumbersUSA are the most recent additions to our scorecard 
collection. We’ll be updating these scores occasionally to ensure accuracy.
