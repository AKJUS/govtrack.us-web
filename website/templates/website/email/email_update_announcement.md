Health care is back on Congress's agenda. The new "Graham-Cassidy" proposal would repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act (aka ACA/Obamacare). Here's what it would do:

- Repeals the individual and employer mandates and cost requirements for coverage of preexisting conditions
- Caps Medicaid spending
- Pauses federal dollars going to Planned Parenthood for one year

Check out [USAToday's summary of the bill](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/19/graham-cassidy-health-care-bill/681029001/). The Washington Post also [compares the new proposal to the last repeal attempt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/cassidy-graham-explainer/?utm_term=.63b31e745076).

Next action?

- There will be a [Senate Finance Committee hearing](https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearing-to-consider-the-graham-cassidy-heller-johnson-proposal) Monday at 10:00 a.m. EDT.
- No vote has been scheduled yet
- Congress has until the end of the month to attempt a repeal before budget reconciliation rules expire and the vote threshold in the Senate goes up to 60.
