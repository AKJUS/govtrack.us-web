Are you getting the most out of GovTrack? GovTrack has a variety of 
tools for tracking Congress, new and old. But with so much information 
readily available it can be hard to know what’s out there. That’s why 
we’re providing weekly tips on how to get the most out of GovTrack in 
your regular email update. Today, we’d like to show how to compare text 
from bills.

## About Text Comparison

The GovTrack text comparison tool allows you to view two bills 
side-by-side to see how much they have in common. You can also compare 
previous versions of a bill to see how it has changed. Any differences 
in text will be highlighted in red. Here’s an [example comparison between 
S. 2155 when it passed the Senate and when it was first introduced](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s2155/text#compare=is):

You can compare bills in the top right corner of the text section of 
certain bill pages. This option will only appear for bills that share 
text with other bills or have more than one version.
