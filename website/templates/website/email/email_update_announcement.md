Are you getting the most out of GovTrack? GovTrack has a variety of tools for tracking Congress, new and old. But with so much information 
readily available it can be hard to know what’s out there. That’s why starting today we’ll be providing weekly tips on how to get the most
out of GovTrack in your regular email update. Today, we’d like to share our Congressional Misconduct Database.

## About the Misconduct Database

In our new [Congressional Misconduct Database](https://www.govtrack.us/misconduct) we have chronicled 372 allegations of misconduct by 
representatives and senators from 1789 to today, including corruption, sexual harassment and abuse, expulsion from Congress, and more. You can 
sort the data by tags on the type of misconduct or the resolution of the case.

We will be writing about trends and interesting cases we have noticed in a series of articles, starting with our [introductory article](https://govtrackinsider.com/introducing-govtracks-congressional-misconduct-database-7d49f677fbce) on sexual 
harassment. We invite you to use our data to learn more about the history of misconduct and how it was handled, as well as to stay up-to-date 
with the latest cases. We’ll be working regularly to keep the database as comprehensive as possible.
