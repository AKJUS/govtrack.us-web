We wanted to share some ways we're tracking COVID-19 in Congress.

1. We just published [What did Congress do during the 1918 flu pandemic?](https://medium.com/p/what-did-congress-do-during-the-1918-flu-pandemic-c0bd96ad2287?source=email-51cfa67992b0--writer.postDistributed&sk=a3ce115fc93bcb3bd552de1fc4c4f9bd) which has some interesting parallels to today.

2. We're tracking the [legislative actions Congress is taking related to COVID-19](https://www.govtrack.us/covid-19).

3. We're tracking the legislators who are unable to legislate because of COVID-19 at <https://www.govtrack.us/covid-19>. So far, 51 representatives and senators are or have self-quarantined or took other  action, or no action, after coming in contact with someone with COVID-19 or testing positive for COVID-19 themselves. Right now three senators and eight representatives are self-quarantining.

Stay safe, everyone.
