Are you getting the most out of GovTrack? GovTrack has a variety of 
tools for tracking Congress, new and old. But with so much information 
readily available it can be hard to know what’s out there. That’s why 
we’re providing weekly tips on how to get the most out of GovTrack in 
your regular email update. Today, we’d like to show how to save your 
position and comments on a bill.

**How to save your opinion on a bill**

In the top right corner of any bill page you’ll find two ways to take a 
stance on a bill. The first is by picking an emoji reaction to the bill. 
All users can see how many times each emoji was picked, which can give 
an idea of what some GovTrack users think of the bill.

The other option is to save your opinion on a seven-point scale and 
leave yourself a note, which only you will see. When you click “all 
positions” you will find a list of every bill you saved and any notes 
you left on them. This can be helpful for keeping track of bills you 
care about.
