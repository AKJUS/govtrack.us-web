Are you getting the most out of GovTrack? GovTrack has a variety of 
tools for tracking Congress, new and old. But with so much information 
readily available it can be hard to know what’s out there. That’s why 
we’re providing weekly tips on how to get the most out of GovTrack in 
your regular email update. Today, we’d like to show you how 
Congressional and White House staff are using GovTrack.

**What is Congress browsing?**

At the bottom of the “About Us” menu is a link to a live record of any 
time someone visits GovTrack.us from within the United States Capitol, 
the White House, and their associated office buildings. We created this 
page last year because in March 2017 the U.S. Congress passed a bill 
that rolled back regulations prohibiting Internet service providers from 
selling subscribers’ browsing habits to advertisers. So it’s only fair 
that we publish their browsing history on our site.
