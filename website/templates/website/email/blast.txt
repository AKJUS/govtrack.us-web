GovTrackers,

This week President Trump terminated the nation's first and only advisory committee to make a more open government,
which I served on in my personal capacity as a volunteer. That's actually not why I am writing you, but it is on the nose...

I don’t have to tell you how important it is that we track our elected officials, or how difficult it is to keep up with the steady stream of news out of 
Washington. That’s why after twenty years of tracking the U.S. Congress, it’s time for GovTrack.us to do more.

It’s time to shine the same light on the White House.

But we can't do it unless you subscribe.

We need to raise $60,000 by March 19 to expand our team. So far $43,255 has been pledged --- that’s not enough.

Will you help us reach our goal?

Click here to subscribe and back this project on Kickstarter:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/govtrack/alert-new-executive-order?ref=1pcfhu

If we reach our goal, we’ll start tracking the President and the White House with updates to you about:

* Executive orders and other official actions
* Actions to downsize and reshape the government, including layoffs, firings, appointments, and cuts
* Other things like this you may be reading about

In our updates we'll include

* The official text of executive orders so you can read it for yourself.
* Context from us about what it means and why it’s happening.
* Updates on court challenges and how new executive actions are being implemented.

Just like we do for Congress, this is a project about what your government is actually doing. No bluster or hyperbole.

But if we don’t reach our funding goal, we won’t get any of the pledged support and this project will die like a bill stuck in committee. Pledge a contribution to make it happen at this link:

Thanks so much!
