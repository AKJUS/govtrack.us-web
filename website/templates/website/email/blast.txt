Happy Constitution Day!

Today 230 years ago the Constitution of the United States was signed in Philadelphia. GovTrack.us hasn’t been around quite as long, but we’ve seen a lot in our 13 years of tracking the United States Congress.

We have some news to share with you about GovTrack. Read on to learn more about our CallBot and our 2017 Backer Update, and then please consider supporting our work!

2017 Backer Update
==================

We would like to share with you our 2017 Backer Update that we sent sent to our supporters, in which we highlight some of GovTrack’s recent accomplishments and plans for the future, including recent GovTrack Insider articles and a new data analysis.

We have a new way for you to reach Congress	
===========================================

Our new CallBot help users like you stay on top of key votes via Facebook Messenger. We’ll let you know about upcoming issues where your voice matters, then walk you through how to call your members of Congress. Our CallBot users have already made hundreds of phone calls to Congress about healthcare and immigration.

Signing up for our CallBot alerts is easy. Just follow this link and say “Hi” to us on Messenger and we’ll get you set up:

Reaching every American
=======================

Our mission has changed from a technology-first pursuit to one about making information about Congress accessible for every American (read more about that in our backer update).

* We are improving the site for those with visual disabilities and who use accessibility tools.

* Hola hispanohablantes! We added a Translate button at the top of every page so Spanish speakers can use GovTrack too!

Did you know we post summaries of bills on GovTrackInsider.com?
===============================================================

Be sure to add our bill summaries to your email alerts <https://www.govtrack.us/events/govtrack-insider> or visit https://govtrackinsider.com/ for our latest articles about legislation in Congress.

Your support is crucial for our ability to bring greater transparency to Congress

Our entire budget is less than most nonprofits pay their CEOs, and yet we’re the front line for keeping 10 million Americans each year informed about the daily activities of the United States Congress.
