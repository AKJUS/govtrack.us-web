Hello and thank you for using GovTrack.us.

Users often ask us to summarize the bills in Congress, so earlier this summer we added a researcher to our team to do just that. The new bill summaries have appeared in your email updates, on the new GovTrack Insider, and on the GovTrack website.

If you think we should keep writing summaries of bills, we need your help.

Will you support GovTrack today by contributing $250, $100, or $50?

We launched a Kickstarter to fund our unbiased reporting of congressional legislation and Congress’s daily activity. Please follow the link below to support us:

We’ll only be able to keep the new researcher on staff with the support of GovTrack users like you.

If we can reach our goal of raising $35,000 we’ll be able to keep posting bill summaries and daily reports for the next 6 months. We've raised $5,170 so far. This is the first time in 11 years that we’ve asked GovTrack users for help like this.

As you may know, for the past two months GovTrack has been working to add a reporting side to the website. This has included the new GovTrack Insider reports on the activity of Congress as well as summaries of bills, which we have been including in email updates, all to make it as easy as possible for users like you to stay informed about your government. Now, as Congress’ summer session comes to an end, we’d like to ask for your help to continue this work.

Thank you for using GovTrack,
