Dear GovTrack user,

You did it! With your support, our Kickstarter campaign was successful! We raised a little more than $35,000 from 900 supporters.

GOVTRACK INSIDER

That has let us hire four part-time researchers who for the next six months are going to read bills and keep you better updated about what's happening in Congress. We're calling this project GovTrack Insider, and you can find our new posts on Medium at https://medium.com/govtrack-insider.

Our recent posts have already covered some controversial legislative issues including:

* The Ex-Im Bank
* CISA, a cybersecurity bill
* Defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing Obamacare by bypassing the Senate filibuster
* Criminal sentencing reform

You can also get these posts in your legislative alert emails from us by signing up at:

https://www.govtrack.us/events/govtrack-insider

^^^^ sign up!! ^^^^

(Once the six-month period ends we'll need to find a new funding source to keep it going. As you read our posts, if you find it helpful, please think about whether you would support the continuation of the work.)


WEBINAR

I'd also like to invite you to join us for a webinar. GovTrack's founder Josh Tauberer (me) and GovTrack Insider reporter Ben Hammer will be holding a webinar to talk about how GovTrack works, the legislative process in the U.S. Congress, and how to be the best advocate for your issues. We'll be holding the webinar at three times:

  Saturday, November 14 at 2:30pm Eastern Time
  Friday, November 20 at 4pm Eastern Time
  Saturday, November 21 at 4pm Eastern Time

The webinar will be interactive --- so bring your questions. If you would like to join, please fill out this form so we can send you further details:

We hope to see you!


PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES VOTE TRACKER

The press has been focusing on the missed votes of some of the presidential candidates who happen to also be sitting senators (Rubio, Graham, Cruz, Sanders, and Paul) or were in the past (Clinton). We've launched a real-time missed votes tracker so you can see exactly how the candidates stack up, including with a comparison to the corresponding time period ahead of the 2008 election. Check it out:

SITE UPDATES

We've also made a ton of improvements to GovTrack over the last six months, including:

* Totally new bill action history tables.
* Improved bill search --- our search functions will find bills more relevant to your keywords now.
* Roll call vote sorting options like widest margin, summaries of some major votes.
* And lots lots more.

For more details on these updates, see https://www.govtrack.us/blog/2015/10/04/govtrack-updates-for-spring-summer-2015/.
