Lawmakers Who Aren’t Making Law
--------------------------------

The press’ quarterly report cards on Congress are out and the picture isn’t pretty. The current Congress has enacted fewer bills than any other Congress in modern history at this point in the legislative session.

Just 21 bills have been passed by both the House and Senate and signed into law since the 113th Congress convened in January. What’s more, the number of bills introduced in this Congress – 4,753 – is also significantly less than past Congresses.
